As a programmer I always use `mkdir something && cd something`
As an average it will take 8 seconds to write this. In a day we might need this command 5 times. So:
- 40 seconds in day
- 5 minutes in a week (280 sec)
- 4 hours in a year

So you actually wasted your time on this command
## What about using shorter command
What about using command `enter something`?
Ok, It will take 4 seconds. And we again need 5 times:
- 20 seconds in day
- 2 minutes in week (140 sec)
- 2 hours in a year

So We made this 2 times faster.
## Enter command
This repo Just has a function that will replace mkdir and cd
### Installation
first clone the repo and use it :
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mehanalavimajd/enter.git
